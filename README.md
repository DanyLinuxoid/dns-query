# mailchecker

Program checks if some mail exists via telneting to mail servers
Program cannot check if user exists on websites, only mail services.
Also capable to check from file with mail services.

#Use this program carefully
As overusing this program can led your IP to be in mail blacklist, use VPN/Dynamic IP etc.
